## About

This is a little project I made to help me with budgeting. The idea is that whenever you make a purchase, you can log into this app, which will
have a section to view recent transactions to verify purchases by adding a more complete description. If there are any transactions that you don't recognize, you can
take action on your end and refute the fraudulent charge.

To do this, I used Plaid to connect to your bank to pull recent transactions that have yet to be verified within the app.

In the future, the goal would be to create a whole transactional ecosystem where you can track purchases on vacations, get a breakdown for budgeting your expenses, and more.
